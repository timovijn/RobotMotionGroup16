# Ambulance Traffic Trajectory Using RRT

RRT algorithm (MATLAB) for finding a path through (stationary) traffic. Based on [Automated Parking Valet](https://www.mathworks.com/help/driving/examples/automated-parking-valet.html) and [2D/3D RRT* Algorithm](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/60993-2d-3d-rrt-algorithm).

Submission for the course Robot Motion Planning and Control (ME47035) at Delft University of Technology.
